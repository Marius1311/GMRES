# GMRES
Implementation of the generalized minimal residual method 

There are three files here, GMRES.m is the function that can solve linear systems of the form Ax = b using GMRES. Examples is a skript that contains some examples of how to use the algorithm and givensrotation.m is a function that creates givens rotation matrices.
